## My Day

Here's a blog post about my day! First I got up to take a **hot** shower, and then threw on some clothes to begin online school at Epicodus. Next, I hopped on my computer & learned for 8 hours! I just got done making dinner, & am currently doing homework!

## My Favorite Food

My favorite food has to be pasta, I grew up eating pasta, and have been in love with it forever!
